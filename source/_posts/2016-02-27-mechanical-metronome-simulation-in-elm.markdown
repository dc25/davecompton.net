Here's a simultation of a mechanical metronome.  At first this was supposed to be an implementation of the Rosetta Code task, "Metronome" : [http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Metronome](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Metronome).  Along the way though I decided to implement the view function using SVG graphics alongside the collage based graphics.  The code for both remains in place and might be a good reference for someone interested in SVG.

The [source is on github](https://github.com/dc25/metronomeElm).  And a [working demo is there too](http://dc25.github.io/metronomeElm/).

The tick/tock sound is a wooden spatula knocking against a cutting board.
