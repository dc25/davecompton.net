Here are some rss tricks (I'm sure there's a better word but that will do for now).   I'll add more as I learn about them.

* For reddit.com/r/rust rss feed, use : www.reddit.com/r/rust/new/.rss

* For stack overflow questions tagged rust use: https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/rust?sort=newest

* For google alerts, create the alert via alerts.google.com, edit the alert to "Deliver to" rss feed, then follow the RSS icon for the new alert.

* For twitter, use a nitter instance.  For example: https://nitter.moomoo.me/JamieMetzl/rss

* For mastodon, use, for example, https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez.rss
