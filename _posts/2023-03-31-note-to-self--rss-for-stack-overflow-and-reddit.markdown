Here are some RSS tricks (I'm sure there's a better word but that will do for now).   I'll add more as I learn about them.  

* For reddit.com/r/rust RSS feed, use : www.reddit.com/r/rust/new/.rss

* For stack overflow questions tagged rust use: https://stackoverflow.com/feeds/tag/rust?sort=newest

* For google alerts, create the alert via alerts.google.com, edit the alert to "Deliver to" RSS feed, then follow the RSS icon for the new alert.

* For mastodon, use, for example, https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez.rss

* For twitter, use a nitter instance.  For example: https://nitter.privacydev.net/nytimes/rss .   Twitter seems to be a moving target.   
     * As of 8/21/2023, the twitter/nitter technique here worked but it may not last. 
     * As of 09/01/2023 it's broken.
     * If anyone reading this knows a way to view a twitter feed as rss, please let me know.
