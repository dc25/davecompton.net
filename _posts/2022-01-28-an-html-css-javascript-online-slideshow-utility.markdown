[This is my second attempt at creating a slideshow utility.](https://github.com/dc25/slideshow1)  [The first one]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/09/06/a-flickr-slideshow-with-help-from-elm.html) was written in elm and would query flickr to get slides.  This one is written in typescript and expects the slides to be served via html and listed in a yaml file (also served via html).   I didn't write much of the code - most of it is originally from stackoverflow.  See the README for details.
