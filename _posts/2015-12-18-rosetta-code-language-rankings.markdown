Here's a table that shows the number of tasks solved per language on the Rosetta Code website.  The table is updated with the latest data from [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org) at page load time.  The code for this site is written in Haskell and compiled with the ghcjs compiler.  Here's the source:  [https://github.com/dc25/Rank_languages_by_popularity/tree/webVersion](https://github.com/dc25/Rank_languages_by_popularity/tree/webVersion)
