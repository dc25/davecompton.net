There are a number of sites that will host images for free.   Some of these are demonstrated below.   Remember these are free solutions that may or may not be maintained so it's probably a good idea to keep local copies of all your photos (i.e. don't use these for storage - just for display).   I may add to the collection if I learn about other hosting options.

# github:
![image from github](https://github.com/dc25/birdphoto/raw/main/bird.jpg)`
I got the image link by :
* Uploading the image to [a github repository](https://github.com/dc25/birdphoto).
* Clicking on the [image in the repository](https://github.com/dc25/birdphoto/blob/main/bird.jpg)
* Right clicking on the download link and selecting "Copy link address"
