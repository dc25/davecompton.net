I’ll update this page as I go.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="mafl-lxc">Mafl LXC</h1>

<p>Installation went smoothly.   Access was in browser via port 3000. This results in a page that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dc25/davecompton.net_images/raw/main/mafl_home_page.jpg" alt="image from github" /></p>

<p>As far as I can tell, each of these icons is a link that by default is not enabled.   I looked briefly at the documentation to find out what it takes to get them working but got impatient and moved on.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="heimdall-dashboard-lxc">Heimdall Dashboard LXC</h1>

<p>Again, install went smoothly.   Access through port 7990, Used the builtin gui to add a couple of “apps” resulting in this:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dc25/davecompton.net_images/raw/main/heimdall_dashboard.jpg" alt="image from github" /></p>

<p>These are clickable and I configured them to link to the plex and pi-hole web interfaces.</p>

<p>I’m starting to get the impression that a “dashboard” is just a fancy collection of bookmarks.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="homepage-lxc">Homepage LXC</h1>

<p>Again, install went without a hitch.   Access using browser at port# 3000.   Configure using scripts at /opt/homepage/config . I added plex and LMS to get a setup like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/dc25/davecompton.net_images/raw/main/homepage_dashboard.jpg" alt="image from github" /></p>

<h1 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h1>

<p>These seem pretty easy to install and configure but I don’t think they buy you all that much.   I’ll probably stick with plain old bookmarks.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;davecompton7@gmail.com&quot;}</name><email>davecompton7@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m trying out some of the “dashboards” for proxmox listed under the tteck scripts collection.

<p>Now, per <a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH">OpenSSH instructions</a> , open port 22 , install openssh as a service, and start the service</p>

<p>That seems to be <em>almost</em> enough but when I try to log in remotely, ssh rejects my password:</p>

<p>At this point I searched online a little for a solution but eventually gave up (for now).</p>

<p>I restored the machine to its previous state.   Thanks to <a href="https://superuser.com/a/1237985">this superuser.com answer from “Vomit IT - Chunky Mess Style”</a> for telling how to undo the firewall changes.</p>

  <li>run update-grub.</li>
</ul>

<p>I did this but nothing changed.</p>

<p>The reason that nothing changed is that Mint had taken ownership of the boot process.   After booting into Mint and making the same changes, the default boot option was updated as expected.</p>

<p>Looking back, this should have been obvious but it cost me a few minutes.</p>

<p>At some point, I expect that an Ubuntu update will again rewrite the grub configuration and I’ll have to go through the process again on the Ubuntu side.</p>]]></content><author><name>{&quot;email&quot;=&gt;&quot;davecompton7@gmail.com&quot;}</name><email>davecompton7@gmail.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple months ago I added Linux Mint as a boot option on my work computer.

<p>Here’s a way to configure Gnome to display some useful information on the Ubuntu Gnome desktop.  I use a variety of virtual machines and it’s nice to be able to easily tell which machine I’m dealing with at any one time as well as having the ip address for ssh access to that machine.  I use this extension to display the machine name and ip addresses.   I also show some other information but that’s easy to configure so if you use this extension, you can decide.</p>

<p>The code resides <a href="https://github.com/dc25/cmd_wallpaper">on github</a> .   It consists of less than 50 lines of javascript and a few lines of json.  Most of the code came from the answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29816027/a-simple-way-to-show-my-hostname-ip-in-gnome-panel-or-on-my-desktop-background">this stackoverflow question</a> .   I made a couple minor modifications.</p>

<p>Usage instructions are in the README for the project. They amount to copying the project to a path in your local machine and specifying a program for the extension to run.  I use the following shell script:</p>

<p>This results in a desktop that looks like this:</p>
