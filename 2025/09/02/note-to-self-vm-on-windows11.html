<meta name="description" content="After upgrading to windows 11, virtualbox no longer worked. Spent a little time trying to fix but gave up eventually. Others seem to be having similar problems. Tried disabling hyper-v per: disable hyper-v by running “Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor” in powershell. Also accessed hyper-v setting through control panel. This appeared to have disabled hyper-v (as seen in control panel) but didn’t seem to help with virtualbox. Gave up on virtualbox and decided to try vmware. Had to create support.broadcom.com login. Downloaded vmware from broadcom. VMWare Workstation Pro for windows under free downloads. Spent some time trying to get bridged networking to work but eventually gave up and decided to fall back on NAT (which actually should be fine). per: This askubuntu answer was able to mount from windows host using : “sudo mount -t fuse.vmhgfs-fuse .host:/ /mnt/hgfs -o allow_other” also per: This askubuntu answer use “.host:/ /mnt/hgfs fuse.vmhgfs-fuse auto,allow_other,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0” in /etc/fstab to get mount to persist. Files created with this mount are owned by root. Still needs work. Left hyper-v off for now. Is this a problem? Installed open-vm-tools as follows: “sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop” per : https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=2073803" />
